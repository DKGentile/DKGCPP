3.24) Assuming that phone numbers are assigned to departments, 
HAS_PHONE would be redundant in the EMPLOYEE table if their
respective phone numbers were displayed for every DEPARTMENT 
each EMPLOYEE is assigned to.

One EMPLOYEE can be assigned to many DEPARTMENTs, and each DEPARTMENT
can be assigned many EMPLOYEEs
 
3.25) COURSE can have no TEXT, but a TEXT must be assigned to a course.
An INSTRUCTOR can have no course, but a COURSE must have and INSTRUCTOR.

We only need a relationship between INSTRUCTOR and COURSE. There is no need
to link INSTRUCTOR and TEXT because TEXT is dependant on COURSE, so every TEXT
assigned to a COURSE would automatically correlate with the INSTRUCTOR assigned 
to COURSE.
