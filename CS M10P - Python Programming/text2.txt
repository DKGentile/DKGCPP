If I give these highly condensed details, it is so everyone can fully understand the importance of this maritime transportation company, known the world over for its shrewd management.
No transoceanic navigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability, no business dealings have been crowned with greater success.
In twenty-six years Cunard ships have made 2,000 Atlantic crossings without so much as a voyage canceled, a delay recorded, a man, a craft, or even a letter lost.
Accordingly, despite strong competition from France, passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference to all others, as can be seen in a recent survey of official documents.
Given this, no one will be astonished at the uproar provoked by this accident involving one of its finest steamers.
